PLEASE NOTE:
JUMP + M(X,0:19), JUMP + M(X,20:39) and JUMP Instructions should not be written the traditional way (declaring which bits to read) 
they should be written like this: JUMP + M(3L) or JUMP + M(3R)

Doing the MUL instruction will save the product in both the Accumulator Register and the MQ Register

Write your program in the program.ias file to be able to run it

the program.ias file must be in the same folder as the .jar file
